## What is Tonatona?

`Tonatona` is **meta** web application framework, which handles lots of annoying and boring tasks on real world web development such as environment variables, logging, etc...

`Tonatona` **does not** provide explicit ways to realize core functionalities of web applications.
It means that you can use your favorite framework based on `Network.Wai`! (e.g., Servant, Spock, Scotty, etc...)
